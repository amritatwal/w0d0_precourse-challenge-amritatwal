## Summary

This is a tribute page I have created for FreeCodeCamp’s Responsive Web Design certification. In it I pay tribute to Chelsea Women's forward Fran Kirby. Instead of choosing to shed light on one of Chelsea's male footballers, I chose Fran as the subject of this tribute instead, hoping to challenge my own instincts when it comes to showing appreciation of the incredible amount of talent seen at the club I support.
